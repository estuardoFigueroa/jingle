                    It is incredibly important to have a professional quality recording of your music before you try to shop it around. Even if a music supervisor loves your song, he would not pick it if it's not recorded in broadcast quality. Here at Tikal Studios we make sure that is taken care of.

                    Mastering is the final stage in the production process and ensures that the music fits together seamlessly and that it is presented with the best possible sound. It involves editing and compiling the required mixes and tracks in production order, and then producing the final master.
